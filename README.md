# KoboldIJ
The [KoboldIJ](https://artenatech.com/index.php/koboldij-llm-plugin-for-ide/) plugin for IntelliJ IDEA provides seamless integration with a self-hosted Large Language Model (LLM) powered by the Koboldcpp interface. This allows developers to make fast, secure, and free LLM requests directly from their development environment without relying on external APIs or public LLM rules. You can leverage any Koboldcpp-compatible public model (GGUF), including models fine-tuned to your specific needs using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technology.
